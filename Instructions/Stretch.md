## Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. 

These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. 

Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

- Add routing into this app and build out some other pages

- Go to the [Coin Gecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/) where we got this data from, and add more features to your app. 

Maybe you want to make a dropdown list of coins, and only look at one coin at a time. 

You could make an API call to that API for a specific coin and get more data on it. 

You could get more specific coin data for the last 24 hrs. 

There's a lot you can do with this API. 

Explore and have fun!

- Look into the recharts library and build a new chart. 

Or change the appearence of the charts we built out here. 

Maybe when you toggle to dark mode, the line on the chart could change colors! 

There's a lot you can do with this library.
