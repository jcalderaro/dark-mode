### Description

In this project you'll take this crypto currency tracker app and build two 
custom hooks that, when composed together, will allow users to set 
and persist a dark mode preference.

## Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Build a custom hook that let's you save data to localStorage

- [ ] Build a second custom hook that sets the `dark-mode` class on the body element

- [ ] Compose your two new hooks together to be able to set and persist your user's dark mode preference in your app

- [ ] Write tests that use mocks and spies to handle dependencies 
in your components
